# Hospital Appointment Scheduling Solution (Smart India Hackathon)

## Problem Statement

Optimizing Doctor Availability and Appointment Allocation in Hospitals through Digital Technology and AI Integration.

## Problem Description

The current scheduling process in hospitals leads to long wait times for appointments due to inefficiencies in manual scheduling based on outdated schedules and spreadsheets. There is also a lack of real-time visibility into doctor schedules and presence in the hospital, making it difficult to accommodate urgent appointments or walk-ins. Appointment no-shows further impact doctor utilization.

## Proposed Solution

We aim to develop a digital system that streamlines the appointment scheduling process in hospitals by automating the process of identifying doctor availability and appointment slot allocation. The system will utilize advanced technologies such as RFID, face detection, proximity of mobile phones, or any other relevant technology to detect the presence of doctors in the hospital. An AI engine will be used to allocate appointment slots based on the doctor's presence and the number of waitlisted patients.

### Key Components

- Doctor location tracking infrastructure and integration APIs
- Central appointment scheduling software
- Patient engagement and communication platform
- AI engine to optimize scheduling based on doctor availability, skills, and patient needs
- Analytics dashboards and reports
- Flexible rules engine to configure optimization constraints or policies
- Open integration APIs to connect with hospital IT systems

## How It Works

1. **Patient Mobile App:**
   - Allows patients to search for doctors by specialty and view availability.
   - Estimates appointment timing slots using AI based on doctor schedules.
   - Provides patients with a token number and estimated appointment time.

2. **Receptionist Portal:**
   - Receives appointment requests from the patient app.
   - Allows receptionists to review and either confirm or add to the waiting list.
   - Updates doctor schedules and availability after confirming appointments.

3. **Doctor Presence Tracking:**
   - Utilizes biometric systems (fingerprint/face recognition) to detect doctor presence.
   - Integrates with doctor calendars to indicate availability status.

4. **AI Engine:**
   - Forecasts doctor availability and optimal appointment slot duration.
   - Dynamically adjusts appointment time estimates based on real-time doctor presence.
   - Recommends optimal doctor-appointment alignments to receptionists.

5. **Analytics Dashboards:**
   - Provides administrators with insights on doctor utilization rates and patient wait times.
   - Identifies bottlenecks or scheduling issues needing adjustment.
